# Project Specification
The programming language I'm using for my project is Python. I can review works done with Javascript, Python or Scala. I'm not sure yet which Algorithms are the best ones for me, most likely Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, and maybe some Heuristic Evaluation Functions. 

## The Game
I choose to implement a Python version of [Pentago](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago). It's a Finnish board game, basicly like  noughts and crosses. Main objective is to place five glass balls of same color in a row. The board is 6 * 6 and it's divided into four 3 * 3 segments. After your turn you have to rotate one of the segments in either direction. I will develop a simple GUI for the game.
