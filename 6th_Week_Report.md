# What have you done this week?
- I have studied the evaluation and I have developed tests. Additionaly I fixed a lot of bugs and developed new features.
# How has the project progressed?
- Now segment rotation works as intended. I made a checker for illegal inputs too. The AI still doesn't make any clever moves but it will play the game soon.
# What did you learn this week?
- I made a prototype for evaluation algorithm and I learned a lot about testing.
# What has been unclear or problematic?
- Poetry setup. It was very frustrating to install. I managed to install it into venv with pip setup tools.
# What next?
- I'll complete the evaluation function, the game state checker is soon ready too.
